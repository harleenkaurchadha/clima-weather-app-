# About app

In this We are going to make a weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-). We will be fetching live weather data for the current location of device as well as the weather for any city you can think of ,by making HTTP get request to [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/). The app will give the current temperature and based on the weather condition in the city it will give us a message .We will be retrieving the get request response and parsing the JSON file for our required parameters.
